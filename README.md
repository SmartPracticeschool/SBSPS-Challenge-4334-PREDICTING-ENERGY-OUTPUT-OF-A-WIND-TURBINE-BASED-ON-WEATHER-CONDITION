# SBSPS-Challenge-4334-PREDICTING-ENERGY-OUTPUT-OF-A-WIND-TURBINE-BASED-ON-WEATHER-CONDITION
Wind energy is clean,renewable way of generating electricity. In future provided costs are reined in ,the primary focus will be offshore development. Wind power is rapidly developing in practically every part of the world, with growth rates ranging from 10 to 40% per year. Although the pace of growth slackened in 2013,installed global capacity reached an impressive 318GW,for an increase of 200GW inf five years. In 2019 it reached 651 GW. Europe is focusing heavily on offshore development. Three countries - The UK,Denmark and Germany are spearheading this drive. At present , wind turbines are anchored to seabeds in water depths not exceeding 30meters. Studies and tests are being conducted on artificial islands and wind turbines on floating foundations anchores at depths upto 60 meters.
If there is proper prediction of wind energy usage can be increased even more exponentially.

so we designed a model using polynomial regression which can predict the output upto 72hrs.

The files uploaded  are necessary components of the model.
